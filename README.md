# Random Dog Image Generator

This responsive site allows the user to generate three dog images
at a time. I programmed it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and connected
to an API to retrieve the pictures.

I really enjoyed making this site. Though it is simple in scope, 
I learned about fetching from an API.
